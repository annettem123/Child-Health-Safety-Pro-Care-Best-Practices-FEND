Hurdles:  

Refactored app name leading to errors; to overcome this hurdle, I created a new project.

Planning and research took longer than expected

Due to time constraints, I updated the user stories for simpler functionality, moving current MVP to Silver and creating new MVP.

Gathering content including images took longer than expected.

If I had more time, I would:

attach Action Research Paper regarding references, etc., 

create a button and link to National Health & Safety Performance Standards website
